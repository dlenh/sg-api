# studio-ghibli-api

This Studio Ghibli API (https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/) contains information of all 22 of their films. I was able to fetch movie poster images and set them as sources for images tag that were set up in the HTML file. This simple app also fetches the movies' running times and allows users to determine how long it will take for them to finish the selected films. Selected movies will have a red border around them and the total time for the movie marathon is summed and displayed in the DOM. 

This project was great practice with parsing API data. I ready had to understand the differences between arrays and objects to access the information of interest. Only the running time was utilized, but other details like movie description can be displayed as well.
